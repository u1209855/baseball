# Baseball

This project is going to take the data that is here https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/baseball-databank and create a data warehouse for this data. 
The data is baseball statistics/facts for the years 1871-2014. The models or tables will be created in Python and then the tables at the following link will be inserted into those tables.
The data will need to be downloaded from those tables, but the rest of the work should be programmed to do. The end result will have all the data in a postgres database, visualizations
will be made in a Tableau format to answer interesting questions. Some examples include the best batters/pitchers from each state. Most successful managers, when does a player's prime start, etc.
